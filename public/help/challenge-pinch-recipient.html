<h4>Pinch Recipients</h4>

<p>
  A "pinch recipient" in our system is someone who is assigned to <strong>get</strong> an extra gift, just like
  pinch hitters are assigned to <strong>give</strong> an extra gift. 
</p> 

<p>
  The reason you would do this is that sometimes in a gift exchange, it may not be possible to get everyone 
  assigned one on one, or even if it is possible, if the challenge is large it could take a huge amount of time 
  to shuffle people around enough to do so. 
  If that is the case in your challenge, you may want instead to cover the handful of unmatched people by 
  recruiting a few pinch hitters for the people who don't have an assigned writer, and assigning "pinch recipients" 
  for the people who don't have a request of their own. 
</p>

<p>
  Pinch recipients must be people signed up for the challenge. As far as the person getting the assignment is concerned, 
  they will not see a difference between a pinch recipient and a regular recipient. The recipient will just have two 
  givers, and assuming neither one defaults, will get two gifts instead of one.
