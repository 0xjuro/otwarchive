<h4>Pinch Recipients</h4>

<p>
  Sometimes in a gift exchange, it may not be possible to get everyone assigned one to one, 
  or (if the challenge is large) it takes a prohibitive amount of time to shuffle people around enough to 
  make this work. 
</p>
  
<p>
  If that is the case in your challenge, you may want instead to just recruit a few 
  pinch hitters for the people who don't have an assigned writer, and assign "pinch recipients" for the people who don't
  have a request of their own. 
</p>

<p>
  Pinch recipients must be people signed up for the challenge. As far as the person getting the assignment is concerned, 
  they will not see a difference between a pinch recipient and a regular recipient. The recipient will just have two 
  givers, and assuming neither one defaults, will get two gifts instead of one.
