  A skin lets you change the way the archive looks in your browser, so you can customize your reading experience.
  Don't like the archive fonts? You can change them! Don't like the red header? Swap it out for blue! 
</p>
<p class="notes">
  Whatever skin you choose, keep in mind that you are only changing it for yourself -- other archive users
  will see content in whatever skin they are using. In other words, skins are useful for creating your ideal
  reading experience, rather than customizing the way your own stories look to the outside world. 
  (We're working on that part!)

  If you create a great skin that you would like to make available for others to use, you can choose to share
  it by applying to have it approved by archive admins and made public, but this is completely optional.
