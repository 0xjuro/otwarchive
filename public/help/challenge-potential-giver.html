<h4>Potential Givers</h4>

<p>
  Potential givers are listed in order of "match quality" -- 
  that is, people who are a better match are listed ahead of those who are worse matches. 
  You can click the potential giver's name to see details on the match between them and the recipient. 
</p>

<p>
  Not everyone can be assigned their best match, but the matching process tries to assign everyone
  the best match possible as a secondary goal (after trying to match as many people as possible).
