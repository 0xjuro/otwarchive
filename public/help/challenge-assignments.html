<h4>Challenge Assignments</h4>

<p>
  Challenge assignments are listed here by the pseud of the assigned person, along with a link to email them, 
  who their recipient is, and (if they have posted their assigned work) a link to the work along with its wordcount.
</p>

<p>
  If the assigned person has not posted their work, you can mark them as a defaulter by checking the checkbox in their 
  row and choosing <tt>Save Defaults</tt>. You can also mark all users as defaulters who have not posted a work 
  (for instance after the challenge deadline passes). Those assignments will then appear in the Defaulted Assignments
  table where you can assign pinch hitters.
</p>

<p>
  If a work is posted that does not meet your challenge standards, you can remove it from the collection under the
  <tt>Manage Items</tt> page and the work will be removed from the listing, at which point you will be able to 
  come back to the assignments page and mark the writer as having defaulted.
</p> 
  
<p>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> if your collection is unrevealed or
  anonymous, removing the work from the collection will cause it to be revealed!
