<h3>Tagging Help</h3>

<dl id="help">
  <dt>Fandoms:</dt>
  <dd>
  The name(s) of the fandom(s) to which your story belongs. Full names, rather than abbreviations, are preferred. You may list multiple fandoms, separated by commas (for example, if your story is a crossover).
  </dd>
  <dt>Pairings:</dt>
  <dd>
  The romantic pairings in your story. Full names are preferred (for example, "Mickey Mouse/Minnie Mouse"), or you may use a nickname for the pairing (for example, "Snarry" or "McShep"). You may list more than one pairing, separated by commas. Please note that all user-created tags must be 42 characters or less; if your story contains a threesome (or a larger poly group) you may want to use first names only to avoid going over the character limit.
  </dd>
  <dt>Characters:</dt>
  <dd>
  The main character(s) in your story, separated by commas. Full names (personal name and family name) are preferred
  </dd>
  <dt>Additional tags (genre, warnings, other information):</dt>
  <dd>
  Any other tags you want to give your story (for example, "Angst", "Crossover", or "Tentacles"). You may also use this field to warn for things not covered by the Archive Warnings. Please do not enter fandom, pairing, or character names in this field. Multiple tags should be separated by commas.
