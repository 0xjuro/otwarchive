<h4>Public Skins</h4>

<dl id="help">
  <dt>You can share your skins</dt>
  <dd>
    Once you are happy with your skin, if you feel it would be generally useful, you can tick the box to mark it as public.  
    It will be reviewed by archive administrators to make sure it works well and will be useful before it is approved (or not). 
    Please note that if your skin is approved for public use, you will no longer be able to edit or delete it! (Since other
    people may be using it at that point.) 
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Not all skins will be approved</dt>
  <dd>
    We want to keep the set of public skins easy to browse, and all public skins must be approved by a senior coder, 
    so approval may take a while (especially at the beginning), or not happen if we feel it isn't different enough from existing skins, or broadly
    useful. This may have nothing to do with how awesome your skin is! 
    You can still use the skin yourself, however, or share it elsewhere for other users to copy and paste for themselves. 
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Public skins cannot use external urls</dt>
  <dd>
    Please note that if your skin uses external urls (eg, for background images), it will not be approved for public use,
    because we can't be sure that the links will not break somewhere down the line. Sorry!  
  </dd>
    
  <dt>Public skins may be edited by administrators</dt>
  <dd>
    We reserve the right to edit public skins in future (we may have to in order to keep them working if for instance we
    change the underlying HTML). Once you have made your skin public, please be aware that it is part of the archive code and
    may be changed, and please do not apply to make your skins public if you aren't okay with that. 
  </dd>
