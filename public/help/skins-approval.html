<h4>Unapproved skins</h4>
	<p>Anyone can write a new skin and mark it as public so that others can use it. 
  However, the Archive of Our Own cannot guarantee that these skins will work properly or that they are secure. 
  If a skin is marked as approved, this means our coders have looked at it and confirmed that it doesn't contain any malicious code.</p>
  <p>We suggest that you only use skins that are either approved or created by someone you know and trust.</p>
