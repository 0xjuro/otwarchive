<h2>Rich Text</h2>

<p>While the exact behavior of the Rich Text Editor (<abbr title="Rich Text Editor">RTE</abbr>) varies depending on your device, browser, and operating system as well as the source you're pasting from, starting with a well-formatted document will help you get the most out of the <abbr>RTE</abbr>. Here are some general tips for ensuring as much of your formatting as possible will be retained:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> <em>once</em> between paragraphs.</strong> Pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice will insert a blank paragraph, creating additional, and likely unwanted, space between paragraphs when you paste into the <abbr>RTE</abbr>. The Archive uses top and bottom margins to create the appearance of a blank line between paragraphs; you can use the paragraph formatting options in your text editor to create a similar effect without adding extra <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags.</li>
  <li><strong>Use preset styles for headings, quotations, code, and so on.</strong> The Styles option generally found in a text editor's Format menu will often translate into <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags when pasting into the <abbr>RTE</abbr>. Simply changing the font size, font name, or text indent will always fail.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pasting from Specific Text Editors</h3>

<h4>Google Drive</h4>

<p>Google Drive uses inline <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> rather than <abbr>HTML</abbr> to produce bold, italic, underline, and strike-through formatting; it also uses <abbr>CSS</abbr> to change the alignment of text. Unfortunately, we cannot allow this method of formatting on the Archive, so only pure <abbr>HTML</abbr> formatting such as headings, lists, links, and tables is retained.</p>

<p>In some browsers, the formatting may appear to be preserved upon pasting into the <abbr>RTE</abbr>, but it will be stripped by our <abbr>HTML</abbr> sanitizer upon previewing or posting your work.</p>

<h4>Scrivener</h4>

<p>Scrivener users will typically get the best results by going to Scrivener's Edit menu and selecting "Copy as HTML" or "Copy as HTML (Basic, using &lt;p&gt; and &lt;span&gt;)" from the Copy Special submenu and pasting into the <abbr>HTML</abbr> editor rather than doing a standard copy and paste into the <abbr>RTE</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Pasting Specific Types of Formatting</h3>

<h4>Underline and Strikethrough</h4>

<p>Underline and strikethrough formatting are now often achieved with <abbr>CSS</abbr>. Because the Archive does not allow the use of inline <abbr>CSS</abbr>, these text styles are often lost when pasting. (Pasting from web pages that use <code>&lt;u&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;strike&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;s&gt; tags will work.)</p>

<h4>Alignment</h4>

<p>Text alignment is now generally achieved with <abbr>CSS</abbr>, and because the Archive does not allow inline <abbr>CSS</abbr>, text alignment will often be lost when pasting text.</p>

<p>While pasting from sources that use the deprecated <code>align</code> attribute and <code>&lt;center&gt;</code> element will keep the formatting intact, please note that the alignment buttons in the <abbr>RTE</abbr> cannot be used to modify center alignment achieved using the <code>&lt;center&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<h4>Headings</h4>

<p>Text editors apply many different appearances to their preset heading styles. For example, selecting Heading 4 in OpenOffice produces italicized sans-serif text. Even when successfully pasting a heading into the <abbr>RTE</abbr>, this specific visual formatting is <em>not</em> preserved â€“ only the <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> tag is. This is not a bug. <abbr>HTML</abbr> is designed to tell the browser what text means (e.g. "This is a heading") rather than how it should be displayed (e.g. "This should be in Arial"). If you wish to modify the visual display of a heading or any other portion of your work, please use a Work Skin.</p>

<h4>Indented Text</h4>

<p>Indented text is a purely visual effect with no <abbr>HTML</abbr> equivalent and will not be preserved. Please use a Work Skin to indent text.</p>
