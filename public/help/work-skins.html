  You can create custom stylesheets or skins for your works just like you can create skins for the archive, except
  that work skins will change the way your work appears to OTHER readers, and not just you. 
</p>

<p>
  Work skins will ONLY affect the body of the story -- you can't change the archive navigation or background.
  What you can do, however, is create your own classes so for instance you can change the color of some of your text, 
  or indent some paragraphs in a particular way, and so on.

  For example, let's say that I want to make a single word in my text bright blue. Here is what I might do:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/skins/new">Create a work skin</a> with the following content: <tt>.bluetext {color: blue;}</tt></li>
  <li>Select this skin when posting my story.</li>
  <li>In the HTML of my text, I would then give the word this class: <tt>I want &lt;span class="bluetext">house&lt;/span> to be in blue</tt></li>
</ul>
