<h4>Creating skins</h4>
<p>You can enter any CSS in this box. There are public skins with examples of the kind of thing that will work well.</p>
<p>If you need help creating a skin that will do what you want, please contact <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/support">Support</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to allow other users to use your skin, tick the box to mark it as "Public". Our volunteers will add it to the list of official skins after checking it for malicious code. Once it has been marked official, you will no longer be able to edit it.</p>
