<h4>Work Search: Tags</h4>

<p>The fields for Fandoms, Characters, Relationships, and Additional Tags suggest tags as you type. If a tag doesn't appear in the autocomplete menu, it doesn't necessarily mean that the tag doesn't exist on the Archive, just that it hasn't been marked as "canonical" by a tag wrangler. You can type in any word or phrase here. However, a search for the "Jane/John" relationship tag will not bring up works tagged with the more accepted "Jane Doe/John Smith" variant. Try to use the canonical version of a tag if the autocomplete offers one.</p>

<p>The more search terms you enter or options you pick, the more your search results will be narrowed down: Entering two fandoms will only find crossovers of those fandoms, not all works that are in one fandom <em>or</em> the other. Entering two characters only find works that have both. Picking M/M and F/M will only find works that are in both categories.</p>
