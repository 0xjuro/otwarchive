<h4>Fulfilling Assignments</h4>

<p>
  If you have any open challenge assignments, you can choose one of them here if the story you are posting is meant to fulfill one of them. 
  This will automatically add your story to the challenge collection (or submit it for approval) and also mark your assignment
  as fulfilled for the challenge moderators. 
</p> 
  
<p>
  Note: if the collection you are submitting to is moderated, and you aren't a member, your story will not be 
  added to the collection automatically &#8212; it will have to be approved by one of the collection's moderators. 
  If this is a secret/anonymous collection, you might want to make sure you are a member <strong>before</strong> you post,
  as otherwise your story will not be hidden/anonymous until it is approved. (You can join a collection on its
  home page.)
