<h4>Collection Status</h4>

<p>A collection has several preferences that can be set by the owner:</p>

<dl id="help">
  <dt>Open or closed</dt>
  <dd>No-one can add works to a closed collection, though the existing works remain. Many annual challenges have a closed parent collection and open sub-collections as appropriate.</dd>
  <dt>Moderated or unmoderated</dt>
  <dd>By default, collections are not moderated, which means any registered user of the archive can add their works to the collection. The owners/moderators of the collection can still reject stories after they have been posted, if they are not appropriate. If a collection is moderated, all registered users will still be able to post, but their works will not appear in the collection until they are approved by a moderator or owner. Approved members will be able to post automatically without manual approval.</dd>
  <dt>Hidden or revealed</dt>
  <dd>This affects whether you can see the works or not. (e.g. Yuletide is hidden before December 25th.)</dd>
  <dt>Anonymous or not</dt>
  <dd>If a collection is revealed but anonymous, you can see the works but not the author names. (e.g. Yuletide between December 25th and January 1st. Yuletide after January 1st is revealed and not anonymous.)</dd>
</dl>

<p>Owners of a collection can edit the collection preferences and data, and also delete the collection entirely. Moderators of a collection can approve/invite members and add/reject stories.</p>
