<h2>Disable Share Links</h2>
<p>
  This preference allows you to disable the share links which make it easier for others to recommend your works on other sites.

  Please note that once you have posted a work online, it is always possible for a reader to copy and paste a link to your work
  anywhere they wish -- if you want to restrict access to your work here, your best bet is to lock the work to registered users of 
  the archive.
