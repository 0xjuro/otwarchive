<h4>Tag Selection</h4>

<p>
  If you put specific tags into this field (you will be offered an autocomplete that will fill in the canonical tags),
  of any type that you have marked above as allowed, people signing up will have to choose from these tags. This is 
  useful if for instance you want to make people choose one out of five specific fandoms. 
</p>

<p>
  You do NOT have to specify tags for every kind of tag you have allowed. For instance, you can put in five specific fandoms,
  and also allow one character tag. The person signing up will have to choose one of the five fandoms, and but can just
  type in a character tag. (They will only be allowed to use the archive's canonical version of the tag, so you don't
  have to worry about people using different versions of the same character's name.)
