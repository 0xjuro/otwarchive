<h4>Work Search: Numerical Values</h4>

<p>Use the following guidelines when looking for works with a specific amount of words, hits, kudos, comments, or bookmarks. Note that periods and commas are ignored: 1.000 = 1,000 = 1000.

<ul>
  <li>5: a single number will find works with that exact amount</li>
  <li>&lt;100: will find works with less than that amount</li>
  <li>&gt;100: will find works more than that amount</li>
  <li>100-1000: will find works in the range of 100 to 1000</li>
</ul>
