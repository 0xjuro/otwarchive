<h5>Tag Options: Characters and Relationships</h5>

<p>
  Very often, you will want your users to only be able to choose from the characters or relationships that 
  belong to the fandom that they've chosen to sign up for. This is pretty tricky to set up because 
  the archive can't figure out on its own that, for instance, the character "Zaphod Beeblebrox" is in the fandom 
  "Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy". 
</p>

<p>  
  The only way we can provide a linked-up set is if our valiant tag wranglers 
  have linked all those tags together manually behind the scenes. If you send in a request with the tags 
  you want linked either through the support form or through our tag set system, our wranglers will do
  their best to set up the links, but depending on the amount of time and the number of links you need,
  they may not be able to accommodate your request in time for your signup to open.

<p>
  On top of that, you may want to only allow SOME characters from the given fandoms in your challenge. 
</p>

<p>
  There are a few solutions for these problems and here's how they work:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Option 1: Make A Tag Set</dt>
  <dd>
    If you have a limited number of characters or relationships eligible for your challenge, just put them 
    into a tag set and add that to your list of tag sets. Those characters and relationships will then be offered
    to your users with handy tickyboxes, so they don't need to worry about remembering the names or the spelling.
    If you take this option, DO NOT choose "restrict by fandom"! (see below for why)
  </dd>
    
  <dt>Option 2: Canonical Only</dt>
  <dd>
    Don't restrict characters or relationships by fandom, and don't put character or relationship tags into the tag sets. 
    Instead, just check the ticky box to require the canonical versions of all character and relationship tags. 
    This should still result in most of your users
    signing up for the same versions of the characters or relationships. Users will have to know at least enough of the 
    tag they want to type in to get autocomplete results, but that will usually be doable. 
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Option 3: Restrict To Fandom</dt>
  <dd>
    If you have sent in your link requests early enough and the tag wranglers have gotten almost all of them in, and you only have
    a small number of characters you forgot to ask to have linked, choose "Restrict To Fandom" and then put JUST the characters you
    forgot into a tag set, and add that set to your list. Those characters you forgot will be allowed as options to any fandom. 
    UNLESS...
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Option 4: Restrict To Fandom AND Tag Set</dt>
  <dd>
    If you only want to allow some characters from your fandoms, you should tick off BOTH "Restrict To Fandom" and "Restrict To Tag Set". 
    In this case, only the characters/relationships that are in your tag sets AND associated with a fandom by the archive's tag wranglers will be
    available. This lets you limit which characters in a fandom are eligible for your challenge.
  </dd>

  Hopefully with these options, you'll be able to find a solution for your challenge! If you run into difficulties or are confused by
  the options, please contact Archive Support for help (but we are often backed up so please do allow plenty of lead time before you're 
  about to run your challenge if you're going to need extra help).
