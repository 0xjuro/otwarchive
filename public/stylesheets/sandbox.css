/*==SANDBOX: All temporary, development, and unreviewed css lives here. 
Rules will be incorporated into the main cascade by Front End before deploy. 
If you've just coded up a new feature and put in some layout, put that layout here, 
with a comment, and the Front End Santa will make your wishes come true. 
Or if you've put in a fix and you've not yet read the Front End Docs? 
Put your fix in here.
Examples:

/*Fix for issue 996 
.bookmark .header {float:left;}

/*Draft layout for views/shiny/new by astolat. 
It has to be purple, see wiki, ADT meeting 25
.shiny-happy-people table {display:table-cell; 
background:purple; color:#555;}

*/

















/*Some helpful notes
0.875em/1.286 line height = 14px with 18px leading
0.643em  = 9px, so {margin: 0.643em auto;} gives you a single blank line between block elements

We use simple hex greyscale: 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f
0 = black.......greys.........f = white

---border colours, greyscale:
darkest #999
brightest #fff
---background colours
form #ddd
accent #ccc
highlight #eee
---livery is red
ao3/otw #900
darker #700
