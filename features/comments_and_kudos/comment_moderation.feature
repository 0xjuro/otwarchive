Feature: Comment Moderation
  In order to avoid spam and troll comments
  As an author
  I'd like to be able to moderate comments
  
  
  Scenario: Turn off comments from anonymous users who can still leave kudos
    Given I am logged in as "author"
      And I set up the draft "No Anons"
      And I check "Anonymous commenting disabled"
      And I post the work without preview
      And I am logged out
    When I view the work "No Anons"
    Then I should see "Sorry, this work doesn't allow non-Archive users to comment."
    When I press "Kudos â™¥"
    Then I should see "Thank you for leaving kudos"    
    
  Scenario: Turn on moderation
    Given I am logged in as "author"
      And I set up the draft "Moderation"
      And I check "Comments moderated"
      And I post the work without preview
    Then comment moderation should be enabled on "Moderation"
    
  Scenario: Post a moderated comment
    Given the moderated work "Moderation" by "author"
    When I am logged in as "commenter"
      And I post the comment "Fail comment" on the work "Moderation"
    Then I should see "Your comment was received! It will appear publicly after the author has approved it."
      And the comment on "Moderation" should be marked as unreviewed
      And I should see "Fail comment"
      And I should see "Delete"
      And I should not see "Comments (1)"
      And I should not see "Unreviewed Comments (1)"
      And I should not see "Approve"
      And 1 emails should be delivered
    When I am logged out
      And I view the work "Moderation"
    Then I should not see "Fail comment"
      And I should not see "Comments (1)"
      And I should not see "Unreviewed Comments"
      
  Scenario: Moderated comments can be approved by the author
    Given the moderated work "Moderation" by "author"
      And I am logged in as "commenter"
      And I post the comment "Test comment" on the work "Moderation"
    When I am logged in as "author"
