Maybe it's the casualness  of his response; the way he bounces in the chair like he's weighing  up whether their little boat is worth his time. Thinking about his  puppyish enthusiasm for the possibilities he can squeeze out of the  ship, she knows she's being unfair,  knows that he has it in him to love the old junk the way Mal already  loves it, but she can't shake the dislike. He's too light and  easy, gorramit, with his shirt loud enough to hurt the eyes and his  ridiculous moustache. He jars on her the way the whole world jarred  on her, those first weeks and months out of the filth and horror of  Serenity Valley.</p><p>She doesn't stop to  consider why Washburne bothers her like this when she can live with  Bester, loud and bawdy and about a million miles away from  understanding anything that went on in the war. Still, Mal's set on  having him as pilot, and though she's ready enough to argue with  the Captain, she knows she'll abide with his decision once it's  made. That's a habit she ain't never going to shake.</p><p>They've been three  weeks out in the black, cruising while Mal sends waves to world upon  world, trying to call up old acquaintances who might give them some  work. Not that there're many of them: those of them that limped out  of Serenity Valley at the end are mostly in no position to be handing  out favours, and famine and sickness took care of most of Mal's  family while he was gone. She doesn't know whether he blames the  Alliance or himself more for that; it ain't in his nature to be  forgiving, either way. Zoe tries not to think of her own family.  She's loyal to the Captain: that's enough.</p><p>Wash hasn't turned  out to be as much of an annoyance as she'd thought he would be. For  a talkative man, he sure seems happy enough to be alone on the  bridge, out there in the black. She's noticed him slipping off up  there after dinner, when there's no need, really, for a pilot. For  all Serenity gives her the feel of an old-style sailing ship, like  the ones she read about once, riding proudly on the waves where they  had their own law and their own customs, she doesn't really need  someone at the helm at all times. Still, Wash goes to sit up there,  more often than not, once the meal's over and the Captain and Zoe  have slipped into the shared, watchful solitude which still comes as  second nature to them. She guesses she was wrong to think that he  wouldn't like or understand what it was that they got from flying,  guesses that it was dumb to think a pilot wouldn't have some kind  of affinity for the black. He'd come across as someone who was more  interested in the ship as a kind of toy, something which would let  him show his skill. She wasn't entirely wrong \xE2\x80\x93 he does treat  flying like a game, the mechanical vagaries of the old ship like a  challenge \xE2\x80\x93 but there's more to him than that.</p><p>When she sees him  sitting up there on the darkened bridge, staring out at the stars  scattered across the black, she thinks maybe Mal was right to take  him on.</p><p>If Zoe had doubts about  Mal taking on Wash, she has none when Kaylee comes aboard, for all  the girl's all sunshine and sparkles, less in harmony with the  tenor of their war-formed comradeship than Wash could ever be. No one  could resent her sweet chatter, her ways of brightening up the  kitchen with her flowery stencils and the conversation with her  belief they're all as nice as she is. It is Kaylee's insistence  that they should all eat together, cook proper food instead of  drifting into the bridge in the evenings for packets of flavoured  protein, which forces Zoe to listen properly to Wash for the first  time. Although she'd been in the middle of plenty of conversations  with him \xE2\x80\x93 man liked to talk and Bester had always been plenty  ready to slack off work to listen to him \xE2\x80\x93 she'd never taken  part. But Kaylee worries if she thinks anyone is being left out, even  if they're leaving themselves out, so Zoe tunes in to Wash's  babble, stomping his chopsticks across the table to grab a piece of  the fresh beef they'd picked up whilst planetside and mock-booming  'Fee, fi, fo, fum, I smell the blood of a juicy n\xC3\xADu'. Zoe  laughs and glances over at Mal. She is surprised to notice that he's  laughing too, laughter that shows right through his body in a  looseness she hasn't seen since way back when, before Serenity  Valley took all his dreams. Maybe she was wrong to think that Wash's  frivolity wouldn't sit well with the people that war had made them.  Their bellies are full and the Captain's laughing and she \xE2\x80\x93 well,  she's feeling pretty damn fine.</p><p>They're way out on  the edge of the Rim, heading back from a shadier than usual job, when  they run into a Reaver ship. Wandering around out there, miles from  the Core, they got no right to be surprised. but that don't lessen  the shock any. Zoe's up on the bridge, chatting with Wash about  nothing much, when the blip shows up on the nav unit. Zoe knows in an  instant they're looking at trouble: ain't nothing else likely to  be flying about this far out in the black. Wash runs a read, but  before he's finished doing so the jagged-edged ship hoves into  sight through the cockpit window, bearing down on them. The blood  drains from Wash's face and he freezes. For a minute Zoe thinks  he's going to stay like that, transfixed by panic, and then he's  moving again, gripping the ship's controls and flicking the switch  to the intercom.</p><p>'Unwelcome visitors,  people \xE2\x80\x93 we're on the move. Hang on tight.'</p><p>Used to following  orders, Zoe's in the other seat and buckling herself in before he's  finished speaking. Not a minute too soon, either \xE2\x80\x93 he's already  accelerating Serenity well beyond her usual stately cruise. Still \xE2\x80\x93</p><p>'We'll never outrun  them,' she says. 'Predators \xE2\x80\x93 they're built for speed.'</p><p>Hands steady on the  joystick, Wash looks almost relaxed now, his tone not far off its  usual chirpiness. 'Nah,' he says. 'They're limping. 'Sides,  I got a few tricks up my sleeve.'</p><p>He turns back to the  console, urging Serenity on up, soaring right over the Reaver ship.  Zoe wonders where he thinks he's soaring to \xE2\x80\x93 there's nothing  but barren, rocky moons out here, nowhere to run to for protection.  Not that any folk would fall over themselves to help out a ship that  brought Reavers down upon them anyhows. The other ship has fallen  behind some \xE2\x80\x93 they'd taken a minute to turn themselves around  once Serenity shot over their heads \xE2\x80\x93 but it's rapidly gaining  ground. Wash has a look of terrible joy on his face, and she suddenly  realises that he's heading them directly towards one of those  barren moons, aiming the ship right at its heart.</p><p>'<i>He's going to  kill us all', </i>she thinks. And then, '<i>Might be the best  way'.</i></p><p>Zoe watches the rock  growing larger ahead of them, aware of the Reaver ship creeping up on  their tail. '<i>Between a rock and a hard place</i>', she thinks  wryly, and closes her eyes against the impending crash\xE2\x80\xA6</p><p>\xE2\x80\xA6.which doesn't  happen. She opens her eyes again. There's no sign of the moon in the  window. She looks at the nav panel and sees they've left it behind  them. Checking for the Reaver ship, Zoe sees that it seems to have  stopped. On the moon. She lets out a long, admiring breath.</p><p>'Ai ya! You crashed  'em. That was some flying.'</p><p>Wash looks pleased and embarrassed  all at once. 'Just a little feint. Besides, like I said, they were  limping. Knew they'd not enough power to pull back from that if  they were on our tail. And Reavers? Not known for their clear  thinking and foresightedness.'</p><p>She smiles, the  fullest, reallest smile she's ever directed at him. 'Good job.'</p><p>'Thanks. Now if  you'll excuse me, I need to change my pants.'</p><p>Wash rises and heads  for his bunk. As he passes, Zoe sees that his hands are shaking.</p><p>Hanging out on the  bridge when there's no one but Wash free to talk turns to hanging  out there because Wash is the one she <i>wants</i> to talk to. Zoe  finds herself seeking him out more and more frequently. Oftentimes  she finds the Captain up there too, sitting in the co-chair trying to  look as if he really understands how to fly the ship or laughing at  some ridiculous anecdote of Wash's. Seeing Mal up there, or down in  the engine room with Kaylee, Zoe starts to think that he did a good  job of picking his crew. A good job for her as well as him, because  she can't deny that when she comes onto the bridge and hears the  sound of laughter, joy bubbles up in her chest.</p><p>Today she comes onto  the bridge and Wash is alone. The lights are dim \xE2\x80\x93 he's put  Serenity onto autopilot in preparation for bed \xE2\x80\x93 but he's still  sitting there, gazing out of the cockpit window. It seems a curiously  private moment and she turns to go before he notices her.</p><p>'The Ancients called  those stars the Pleiades, did you know?' Zoe looks in the direction  he points, but can't really pick out which of the million dots of  light are the ones he means.</p><p>'Seven sisters \xE2\x80\x93  some god put them in the sky. The sailing stars. The Ancients could  see them from Earth-that-Was, and now we're seeing them from the  other side.'</p><p>Zoe doesn't know what  to say, but she's drawn forward as if a few strides will help her  make more sense of a whole galaxy.</p><p>'Didn't figure you  as having a big interest in old stories.'</p><p>'Just stars. You  might say I've got a little obsession there.' Wash grins up from  by her elbow, close enough that the sleeve of his shirt brushes  against her, and Zoe is suddenly exhilaratingly aware of herself as a  woman. She leans in to kiss him, relishing the looks of confusion,  then panicky excitement, fleeting across his face before their lips  meet.</p><p>'Bunk,'  Zoe says, and pulls him to his feet. She turns and strides off the  bridge, not waiting to see if Wash will follow because she's afraid  if she hesitates they'll end up rutting on the floor of the bridge.  Gorramit if they'd survive the explosion if Mal walked in on <i>that</i>.  Wash trails after her, looking as if his Seven Sisters had just  swooped down onto the bridge and said hello.</p><p>The second they're in  her bunk she turns and grabs his hand, pulls him forward into an  embrace. Their lips meet again and at first he's uncertain, then  Zoe presses her breasts against him and he's suddenly fervent. He  grinds against her and they're kissing and sucking at one another's  tongues until they're gasping for breath and stars are bursting  behind Zoe's eyes. Wash steps back, cupping the side of her face  and taking a long look into her eyes, then his hands are on her,  strong, clever pilot's hands curling round her waist and stroking  her ass. He pushes her top up and her breasts spill out, unruly  against a bra that fitted when they were fresh out of the army.</p><p>Wash's mouth closes  hot around her nipple and she gasps and bucks against him, hands  scrabbling at his pants and then at her own. When he slides his hand  between her legs she feels her wetness coating his fingers almost at  once, heat filling her loins so she's suddenly the one amazed and  helpless in his hands. She's far from being a virgin, but it's  been a long time. She's got Serenity Valley to thank for that, as  for so many things. Now she's gasping and moving against Wash's  hand and -</p><p>He pulls away, leaving  her cold and confused.</p><p>'Zoe, I, I don't  want this \xE2\x80\x93'</p><p>'<i>What?'</i> she  thinks, too confused even for anger.</p><p>He sees her face change  and stumbles over his words. 'I mean \xE2\x80\x93 I don't want this to be  just \xE2\x80\x93 just rutting. I can't have this and then live with you on  this ship the way we did before.'</p><p>His normally laughing  eyes are serious and now it's Zoe who wants to laugh, because it's  so simple.</p><p>'So that's how it  is. Well then, we better see how well you do steering this ship home,  Husband-to-be,' she says, and squeezes his cock so that his breath  catches in his throat.</p><p>Wash's gaze is  steady, and she can see he doesn't quite believe the implications  of what she's said at first. Then he nods, sharp and certain.</p><p>'Best pilot in the  'verse,' he says, with a touch of his usual levity, and he leans  in once more, sliding up her body so he nestles against her breasts.  His hands steady on her shoulders, he rubs his cock against her  wetness, then slides in sure as he steers Serenity. Zoe gasps as he  fills her and they hold still for one long moment, then they're  moving again and all her forgotten passion comes surging through her,  till they're both crying out, hands clasped so tight they'll  bruise come the morning. She clenches tight around him as she comes  and he kisses her neck, then he's flying again, raised up on his  arms and calling out her name.</p><p>Afterwards, they lie  curled together, sleepy and at peace. 'My Zoe, my <i>Xu\xC3\xA1n  W\xC7\x94</i>,'Wash whispers, fingers curling through her hair to  stroke at the back of her neck.</p><p>Zoe thinks it might be  time she had someone who wanted to name the stars.</p><p>n\xC3\xADu \xE2\x80\x93 cow</p><p>Ai ya - damn</p><p>Xu\xC3\xA1n W\xC7\x94 \xE2\x80\x93  black tortoise / black warrior. The black tortoise is one of the  four major Chinese constellations. It is usually represented as a  tortoise or a snake and translated into English as 'black  tortoise', but Xu\xC3\xA1n W\xC7\x94 literally means 'black warrior'.</p><p>The title comes from  Ben Jonson's <i>Hymen\xC3\xA6i</i>.</p>\n\
